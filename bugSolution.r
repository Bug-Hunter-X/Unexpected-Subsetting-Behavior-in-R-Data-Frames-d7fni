```r
# This corrected code demonstrates the proper way to subset a data frame
# based on a logical vector.

df <- data.frame(a = c(1, 2, 3, 4, 5), b = c(TRUE, FALSE, TRUE, FALSE, TRUE))

# Correct subsetting
correct_subset_df <- df[df$b, ]
print(correct_subset_df)

#Explanation:
#In R, a logical vector can be used directly for subsetting. 
#`df[df$b, ]` uses the TRUE/FALSE values in `df$b` to directly select rows. 
#Using `df$b == TRUE` creates an identical logical vector but is unnecessary and can sometimes lead to confusion.
